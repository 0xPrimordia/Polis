## Tactical RPG / Colony Sim
Manage your family and Villa, play your family’s Hoplites across intense RPG/Tactical battles, a detailed event system and epic mythic quests.

With Polis having such a grand scale, development will be split into a series of mini games with a final phase of tying them together. This repo is aimed at our first goal, the battle mini game.

## Deployment
Deploy your characters based on their traits and relationships with adjacent characters. Chose between 2 rows or square formation, deeper columns providing greater defensive bonus and more columns allowing for flanking opportunity at the expense of a thinner line.

A Hoplite is measured by his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arete" target="_blank">Arete</a> which is derived from a base value of talent, training points, ancillaries, moral and fitness (a possible penalty from injury).

## Battle Turns

Each turn you can pick one character's action. Once that character’s action has been used, he cannot use
an action again until all other character’s currently playable have used their actions. 

## Battle Phases

Through the course of the battle, a fatigue meter will wear down. At certain 
points both sides will pull back allowing a reprieve for adjustments to positions and healing actions.

At sunset, both sides withdraw and return to the camp to continue the next day. At this point you can 
re-enforce, if you have the reserves available.
