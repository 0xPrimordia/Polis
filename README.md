# Polis
Tactical RPG / Colony Sim
Manage your family and Villa, play your familyâ€™s Hoplites across intense RPG/Tactical battles, a detailed event system and epic mythic quests.

With Polis having such a grand scale, development will be split into a series of mini games with a final phase of tying them together.

## Battle Mini Game
Deploy your characters based on their traits and relationships with adjacent characters. Chose between 2 rows or square formation, deeper columns providing greater defensive bonus and more columns allowing for flanking opportunity at the expense of a thinner line.
